                <h1>Resident evil 2 remake</h1>
                <p>#1
                    In hardcore and standard it feels very lacking of zombies is there any chance we can get a setting 
                    that can increase the amount of zombies, also there is a bug with the Handgun from claire's found in 
                    police car in campaign it doesn't show in cutscenes even if the Sls60 is in the box please rectify this. 
                    On some of claire's skins her grenade launcher and other guns that go over her shoulders do not appear, 
                    could we also be given access to both campaigns weapons to use on both stories. I love this game so much 
                    it was my birthday present the same week it was originally released. Will we be getting some Ada Wong Dlc 
                    seen pweety pwease</p>

                    <h1>Fiction Based Movies Yet to Be Made</h1>
                    <p>So, between things like Harry Potter, Marvel, and of course, Resident Evil, some of our favorite IP's in 
                        other mediums have made the transition to the silver screen. Some with...Less success than others. 
                        In a time where Hollywood is becoming less and less original, I'm sure we'll be seeing more and more of these 
                        beloved IP's in the years that come, on a screen bigger than our houses, because that's how we forget our 
                        problems. So, with that being said, what are some works of fiction that haven't been adapted yet, 
                        that you actually think could be done well? How would you do it? Why? These are the questions I choose to try 
                        and bring this website back from the dead!
